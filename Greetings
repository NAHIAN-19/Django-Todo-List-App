Another thing, thank you thank you so much , for updating the repo, i needed it more then anything else in this world. again thank you so much.
Thanks for celery integration, before this i have already setup the redis and i was gonna add the celery intergration in our, sorry your code, but i was keep getting database error, so i have decided to code everything from scratch and analyze from where error is coming, but before that , you have already updated this repo and it's working like butter, again thank you
Sir, can you please tell me from where error was coming and is there any other way to contact you rather then github. ðŸ˜€
